\section*{Summary}

MSGARCH is an R package \citep{R} which implements Markov--switching GARCH--type models very efficiently by using C++ object--oriented programming techniques. It allows the user to perform simulations as well as Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation of a very large class of Markov--switching GARCH--type models. Risk management tools such as Value--at--Risk and Expected--Shortfall calculations are available. We refer the reader to \citet{ArdiaEtAl2016} for a full description of the package's usage. The latest version of the package is available at \url{https://github.com/keblu/MSGARCH}.
